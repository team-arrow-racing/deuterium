# Introduction

## Project Description

Deuterium is a project to develop and open-source battery management system suited to the requirements of solar car racing and other mobile energy storage system applications. In time the learnings and implementation details will become a reference for other projects.

### Background

As the market segment for high cell count batteries expands, more streamlined and integrated solutions have been developed by a number of vendors. What used to have to be achieved with a number of discrete components can now be done with single chips that match or even beat the total cost.
### Assumptions and Constraints

- The solution will be produced in relatively small quantities. The need for leveraging economies of scale or pricing down a solution is very little.
- The solution will be used in both stationary and mobile environments and as such needs to be treated as an automotive class system.
- The solution will be used for hours at a time rather than days at a time and as such doesn't need to be designed to run for many days continually.
